# Full Stack Open 2022 Exercises

## Previous History

Have worked with web technologies since the late 1990s. Never really did a whole lot of work in them outside of a couple personal projects and some small paid projects as a kid. I also have worked with more recent technologies breifly, but never deep extensive dives. I do have experience in deploying and writing small applications in Django, NodeJS, and some Rails, but just barely.

## Motivations

I hope to learn a bit more about current web development practices and the ideal environment for deploying said applications. The times of old PHP apps with monolithic backends seems to have come to an end and I would like to update my knowledge to that eventuality. I also believe this could potentially help me to direct my students in best practices and push forward their development.

## Objectives and Goals

Starting as a New Years Resolution to learn, and would hope to finish most of the exercises including the advanced exercises by the end of February. I plan on using the knowledge contained therein to apply it to a project I've been brainstorming for my physical business.

## Section Notes

### Part 0 - Fundamentals of Web apps

Part 0 was a great introduction to developing on the web. The information within would be a great introduction to anyone looking to start web development and doing the later exercises introduced me to a new technology I will be using for diagraming for my classes in the future. While I got little from the material as I knew the majority of the information I believe as an introduction it works fantastic.
